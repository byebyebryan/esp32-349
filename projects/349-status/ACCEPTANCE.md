# 349-status v1 device acceptance

## Short-gate closure — 2026-09-24–25 PDT

This run checks the reviewed v1 fixes on Starship's ESP32-S3 3.49 V2.
The results below are observations from this run, not inherited from the
2026-09-23 prototype checks in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). The physical short gates
passed. The user chose to defer the optional 24-hour connected soak; no
long-duration stability claim follows from this run.

### Build and environment

| Item | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Reviewed source | `3cc419e` (gap fixes), then `9ddb3b6` (device idle logging) |
| Firmware binary SHA-256 | `6b5ac68df8c35373c3dd4460bdc253d5abad3fb64d9f228075b8f144202fd33c` |
| Firmware ELF SHA-256 | `b249b211443c65cc32df54f131c12986f846495017440e869092acab5ceceec0` |
| Live device identity | `hello.build=9ddb3b6`, `hello.build_sha=b249b2114` |
| Host service | User `349d.service`, final restart at 2026-09-24 21:40:45 PDT; active, linked, not paused |
| Board path | `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_28:84:85:92:C2:20-if00` |
| User config | Original config restored byte for byte after isolated tests and reloaded |

The host suite passed 76 tests on `3cc419e`. The final firmware-only commit
passed a clean firmware rebuild before flashing. The device's hello ELF hash
prefix matches that build. These are build and integration checks; the physical
observations follow.

### Completed short gates

| Gate | Observation |
|---|---|
| Static bar and stale state | On the final firmware, `BAR 東京 が 🛸` stayed visible for over 15 seconds. The user reported no stale host overlay or layout artifacts. |
| Font fallback | The user saw `東京` and `が` on both bar and card, with the unsupported emoji shown as a visible box. |
| Injected card and touch | An isolated card appeared and disappeared immediately when tapped. A separate 1,200 ms injected card appeared once and expired at about 1.22 s by host status. |
| Desktop mirror | An isolated `MIRROR A` notification replaced with `MIRROR B` under one desktop ID, then disappeared after desktop close. The user confirmed the board behavior. |
| Local dismiss and replace | In isolation, tapping `ISOLATED LOCAL A` hid the board card while its desktop notification remained. Replacing the same desktop ID with `ISOLATED LOCAL B` made it visible in both places. A prior crowded run was inconclusive and is not counted as a pass. |
| 20-card burst | Twenty unique desktop IDs were sent in 0.168 s. The user saw two board cards and `+18 more`, with the display responsive. The test IDs were closed afterward. |
| Bar width rejection | Reload rejected a 628 px preset for the 624 px bar, then accepted the restored valid config. |
| Replug | The by-id port returned at 21:38:22.121 PDT; daemon link returned 0.302 s later; matching device hello arrived 1.646 s after port return. The user saw the normal state and no stale overlay. |
| Service restarts | Three consecutive restarts each reached matching device hello and full sync in about 1.4 s; the final service stayed active and linked. |
| Device CPU idle | Final-firmware 10-second alive logs reported 92–98% idle on core 0 and 99–100% on core 1 during observed normal/static-bar windows. The first sample after boot is `na` by design. |

After a full USB power loss during replug, the RTC reported `oscillator
stopped` at boot and was set from the host during sync. Subsequent warm
service restarts reported `PCF85063 ok`. This installation now assumes that
host sleep also removes USB power. A powered-off board cannot show a host
asleep overlay or keep a visible clock running; the replug result exercises
the corresponding cold-start recovery path.

### Mirrored popup expiry follow-up — 2026-09-24 PDT

Real desktop popups could disappear while their board cards remained in the
mirror's count. On this host, DankMaterialShell hides a timed-out popup but
retains its notification-center entry without emitting `NotificationClosed`.
Before the fix, a controlled 1,200 ms popup raised the mirror count from 16
to 17; the count stayed at 17 after popup timeout and returned to 16 only
after explicit desktop close.

The host now expires mirrored board cards at the requested positive timeout,
or at the configured fallback for a server-default (`-1`) timeout. A zero
timeout remains persistent until explicit close. This does not remove the
desktop notification-center entry. The host suite passed 82 tests, including
a live D-Bus mirror test that observes a device `close` without first closing
the desktop notification. No firmware change was required.

`349d.service` restarted at 22:34:34 PDT and reconnected to firmware build
`9ddb3b6`. The fresh sync cleared the stale board state (`notifs: 0`). A live
`-1` timeout probe then raised the mirror count to 1 and returned it to 0
after the five-second fallback, before the probe's desktop ID was explicitly
closed for cleanup. The service remained linked with no warning or error in
its journal. This is a headless count/protocol check; a separate visual claim
about the physical display is not made here.

### Symbol fallback follow-up — 2026-09-24 PDT

The user reported that a curly apostrophe in a real notification appeared as
a box. An isolated card confirmed the distinction: ASCII `we've` rendered in
the title, while `we’ve` (U+2019) showed a box in the body. The host preserved
both characters; the firmware's Montserrat/CJK fonts lacked U+2019.

Generated 14/16 px LVGL symbol subsets now follow Montserrat and Source Han
Sans in the fallback chain. The first build (`build_sha=679281b56`) was
flashed and visually checked. Its two font objects used 56,476 and 70,300
bytes of text data, with no static writable data. Post-flash alive samples
showed 92–94% core 0 idle and 99–100% core 1 idle during this observation
window.

On that first build, the user confirmed that both apostrophe forms rendered in both card
text sizes, together with `東京`, an em dash, an arrow, and a check mark. The
unsupported `🛸` still appeared as a box. The host service remained linked.
The 90-second injected test card then expired, returning the host to
`notifs: 0` with the link still active.

A subsequent static audit found missing `×`, `÷`, and several European letters
that the host does not transliterate. Extending the generated font to Latin-1
and Latin Extended-A raised the repertoire to 2,602 code points at each size;
`tools/check_font_coverage.py` passes its two-size coverage gate. The build
flashed for this audit was `build=cf56cea-dirty`, `build_sha=844085c67`,
matching ELF SHA-256
`844085c67c4db83a018231b127dee362495e76e668ccd8425f2a9f5476923efa`.
The app image is `0x1329f0` bytes in an `0x800000`-byte partition, with 85%
free. The two current font objects use 68,089 and 84,573 bytes of text data
and no static writable data. The host linked after the second flash. A
60-second card exercised `×`, `÷`, `ø`, `ß`, `ł`, and `œ`; it expired and the
host returned to `notifs: 0`. The user missed that card, so it was resent for
two minutes. On the second card, the user visually confirmed all six glyphs
and `東京`. Alive samples on the current build showed 93–94% core 0 idle and
99–100% core 1 idle. This remains a targeted check, not certification of
every glyph or script. The firmware image predates the commit of its source.

A read-only audit of the desktop shell's retained history examined only code
points after the host's normalization and byte limits; it did not print or
retain message contents. Its 33 non-test `ghostty` entries used 72 distinct
code points, all covered by the current font. No Chrome, Google Calendar, or
Slack entries were retained in that sample, so their coverage is unmeasured.

### Snap second-board bring-up smoke — 2026-09-25 PDT

Snap's clone was at `36b0dfc`. Its second board uses USB serial ID
`28:84:85:92:C4:3C`; the factory bootloader/partition and app images were
backed up privately under
`~/.local/share/esp32/backups/snap-c43c-factory-2026-09-25/` before flashing.
The user confirmed the normal bar on the first flash, and `349d` was enabled,
active, and linked.

Initial mirrored and direct notification probes entered the host state but
showed no board card, even after a full sync. After diagnostic reflashes and
reconnects, the user saw a direct card and a desktop notification mirrored on
the board. The temporary device logs and stack change were removed; a direct
card remained visible with the original firmware settings. The last flashed
build reported `36b0dfc-dirty` because Snap still had two setup/service edits
in its checkout; no diagnostic firmware edits remain. The cause of the initial
no-card state was not established. This is a second-board smoke check, not a
repeat of all v1 short gates or a long-duration stability check.

### Snap display-freeze follow-up — 2026-09-25 PDT

Later, Snap's clock and cards stopped updating while `349d` remained linked,
its revision continued advancing, and the board continued printing its
ten-second `alive, host=yes` line. The recent device log contained no frame
profiling lines. Source review found a concrete deadlock risk in the shared
display driver: it allows two panel transfers in flight but used a binary
completion semaphore, so two callbacks arriving before a wait could collapse
into one signal and leave the LVGL task waiting indefinitely. A task backtrace
was not captured, so this remains the likely cause rather than a proven
runtime stack trace.

The driver now uses a counting semaphore for the two outstanding transfers,
checks panel draw errors, and restarts after a logged two-second DMA completion
timeout instead of waiting forever. Both local `349-status` and `349-hello`
firmware builds and Snap's `349-status` build passed. Snap's board was flashed
and reconnected with `hello.build_sha=c4abf317e` (`8647e99-dirty`). The user
confirmed that its clock and notifications update again; subsequent device
logs showed frame flushes and normal `alive` lines. This is a short recovery
check, not evidence of long-duration stability.

### Snap active-card cache gate — 2026-09-25 PDT

The capability-gated cache runs on Snap's ESP32-S3 board while the desktop
mirror is temporarily disabled to isolate injected cards. The current app
image on that board was verified after flashing; its device hello reports
`build_sha=2e83e441b`, and the image on Snap has SHA-256
`f3b712fb9b4d696d2685f8bc825c09974aeec57dc2172f73b166390bea119aba`.
The preceding app image was backed up at
`projects/349-status/build/pre-card-cache-app.bin` on Snap before the first
cache flash. These observations were collected before the host and firmware
worktree changes were committed. Both Starship and Snap host suites pass
**105 tests**, and both firmware builds pass.

The first cache firmware reported the exact newest 20 IDs with no overflow,
then the newest 32 of 33 active IDs with overflow one. After a middle card
expired, the host refilled the cache with the formerly omitted older ID; the
device readback matched the host-selected 32 IDs and overflow returned to
zero. Four repeated full transfers with 32 cards committed without a new
parse error, and later expiry removed them all. This was a controlled host
reconnect and reload exercise, not a physical USB replug.

Review then found that an incremental arrival could exceed a configured
`cache_limit` below the physical 32-card capacity, and that a bad transfer
could request redundant resyncs for its queued tail. The final build carries
an effective limit in `sync_begin`, enforces that limit for deltas, and
discards the tail of a failed transaction. A per-boot hello ID avoids the
duplicate full sync observed during the controlled reconnect. On the final
board build, `cache_limit=8` with nine arrivals produced the expected newest
eight IDs and overflow one; `cache_limit=0` with one arrival produced zero
cached IDs and overflow one. A fresh 20-card set matched all 20 ordered IDs
before the physical replug check. The final build's observed minimum heap
after that burst was 75,835 bytes internal and 7,923,996 bytes PSRAM; alive
logs showed 91–93% core 0 idle and 99–100% core 1 idle in this short window.

For the physical replug, the monitor observed link down at 14:39:00 PDT and
link up at 14:39:04. The board's next full transfer committed 20 cards, and
readback returned the same 20 ordered IDs (`100010`–`100029`) with overflow
zero. The user saw the cards and bar return; no stale overlay was reported. The
cards disappeared afterward because their three-minute injected expiry elapsed;
the host then reported zero active cards. A separate two-minute card was
locally dismissed by tapping: the user saw it hide while the bar stayed, and
host status still showed one active notification with its ID in the device
cache. These are short physical and visual checks, not a long soak.

With the host's serial link paused, a direct board probe committed one card,
sent an out-of-order chunk plus the remaining tail of a second transfer, and
queried the device. It emitted exactly one resync request and kept the prior
committed ID. A subsequent valid transfer committed two expected IDs. The
normal host service then restarted and linked to the same firmware; the
original Snap config was restored byte for byte, notification mirroring is
active, and host/device active-card counts returned to zero.

The current two-card visual layout is unchanged. This gate validates cache
state and transport behavior; the side-peek UI is the next separate goal.

### Starship cache rollout — 2026-09-25 PDT

The reviewed display fix, cache implementation, and UI design checkpoint were
committed and pushed through `3062174`. Starship's connected board uses USB
serial ID `28:84:85:92:C2:20`; its preceding app was backed up under
`~/.local/share/esp32/backups/starship-c220-pre-cache-2026-09-25/` before flashing.
The verified new image has SHA-256
`70a12724246edbc9cd9802497bbf5105270adb14c993fbe5c2d567c2ffaaa4da`;
the device reports `hello.build=3062174`, `hello.build_sha=b5f30e365`,
and `card-sync-v1`. The host service restarted at 19:51:13 PDT, resumed,
and linked with a 32-card device capacity. Its config was unchanged, including
the ten-second normal popup fallback. The 105 host tests passed before rollout.

A 90-second `STARSHIP CACHE CHECK` card was read back as ID `100000`.
The user, physically at Starship, confirmed the normal bar and card with
`東京`, the arrow, and check mark. Device logs showed regular frame flushes,
93% core 0 idle and 99% core 1 idle in this short window. The test card later
expired and device readback returned to zero cards and zero overflow. This is rollout
smoke evidence; the broader cache/recovery gates above were exercised on Snap.
Further UI visual and touch checks now use Starship's board.

### Deferred checks and limits

- The 24-hour connected soak was stopped at the user's request because its
  expected value did not justify continuing it now. No soak pass is claimed.
- The recorder cannot see pixels, so unattended operation would not prove
  the absence of every brief stale card or false overlay.

Actual host suspend/wake was not exercised. The assumption that USB power is
removed during sleep has not been measured on this host, and the manual
replug timing cannot prove host-specific wake timing. If this host retains USB
power during sleep, the powered-board overlay, RTC, and resume behavior need
a separate test before making claims about them.

### Soak recorder readiness

The read-only [soak recorder](tools/soak_recorder.py) uses the daemon's Unix
socket, systemd properties, and a journal cursor. It records sanitized device
CPU heartbeats and fails the run on link loss, service or device reset, an
unexpected hello/resync, host suspension, or a collection gap. Its output is
private append-only JSONL. It does not expose notification text. A 12-second
and a 6-second live dry run passed with matching firmware and no failures;
a deliberately wrong build was rejected at baseline. A separate six-second
transient user-unit run exited successfully. These dry runs do not count
toward the 24-hour window.
The recorder also samples at the deadline; a six-second check with a two-second
interval recorded samples at 2, 4, and 6 seconds before reporting success.

If a future connected soak is useful, launch it with a unique UTC run ID in
both the unit and output names:

```sh
rtk systemd-run --user --unit=349-status-soak-RUN_ID \
  --property=Restart=no --property=RuntimeMaxSec=25h \
  /usr/bin/python3 /home/bryan/code/esp32/projects/349-status/tools/soak_recorder.py \
  --duration 86400 --interval 15 \
  --output /home/bryan/.local/state/349-status/soaks/RUN_ID.jsonl \
  --expected-build 9ddb3b6 --expected-sha-prefix b249b2114 \
  --firmware-elf /home/bryan/code/esp32/projects/349-status/build/349-status.elf \
  --device-path /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_28:84:85:92:C2:20-if00
```

The recorder cannot see pixels. A future soak would still need a human visual
check at its start and end for stale cards or false overlays.

### Deferred soak attempt

The user confirmed a normal bar with no stale card or false overlay at the
start. Transient user unit `349-status-soak-20260925T051016Z.service` began
recording at **2026-09-25 05:10:31.797 UTC** (2026-09-24 22:10:31.797 PDT)
to `/home/bryan/.local/state/349-status/soaks/20260925T051016Z.jsonl`.
Its baseline records host service PID `741952`, `hello.build=9ddb3b6`,
`hello.build_sha=b249b2114`, and the matching full ELF SHA-256 above. The
recorder unit started as PID `763720`. At the user's request it stopped at
**2026-09-25 05:14:43.795 UTC**, after 252.019 s and 16 samples. Its final
record is `outcome=interrupted`, with no sampled failures. The normal daemon
remained active and linked. This attempt is not a 24-hour soak pass.

No changes were pushed during this historical soak attempt.

## Starship side-peek UI checkpoint — 2026-09-25 PDT

The UI goal runs on Starship's USB board `28:84:85:92:C2:20`; Snap was not
updated in this goal. The hardware checks below used an uncommitted tree
based on `7aec129`.
The previous cache app (`3062174`) and original Starship config were backed
up under `~/.local/share/esp32/backups/starship-c220-pre-ui-2026-09-25/`.
Desktop mirroring was temporarily disabled for the physical checks so real
agent notifications did not mix with test cards. The original configuration
was restored byte for byte after the tests.

| Build identity | Value |
|---|---|
| Device descriptor | `hello.build=7aec129-dirty`, `build_sha=f758f77b0` |
| Firmware binary SHA-256 | `0c2d5b1f8b9fa41cc2fce3cfc310f1f2e8e3c75f6595b823b545eb94793cae4a` |
| Firmware ELF SHA-256 | `f758f77b0a12615512b7e75fba72505cbda082beaa69df53de65b3b39bcbf79c` |
| App size | `0x215560` bytes in an `0x800000` partition; 74% free |
| Host service start | 2026-09-25 20:57:49 PDT, active and linked |

The firmware build, native focus-policy and dashboard-parser tests, and font
coverage gate pass. Both 20/22 px fonts retain exactly the 2,602-codepoint
legacy repertoire; the 80 px clock has only its 12 selected glyphs. Generating
the assets twice produced identical hashes. The final integrated host suite
passed **118 tests**. A direct-reader regression verifies that stopping after
the first yielded line cannot strand another complete buffered line; this
fix is separate from the firmware console/frame serialization fix below.

### Firmware readback checks

A direct serial probe ran while the daemon was paused. These are state and
protocol observations, not pixel or touch observations:

| Check | Readback |
|---|---|
| First card | Dashboard enabled, one reachable card and the correct focused ID |
| Critical followed immediately by normal | Three cached cards; critical ID 802 stayed focused |
| Foreground close | Focus selected the surviving next ID 801, without dropping unrelated ID 803 |
| Critical introduced by full sync | New critical ID 804 took focus over the retained normal card |
| Identical full sync | Focus remained ID 804 |
| Malformed staged dashboard | `sync_begin_invalid` resync; committed IDs 801/804/805 and focus were retained |
| Snapshot without dashboard | Legacy UI selected; a subsequent dashboard snapshot restored the deck |
| Stale/recovery | Deck marked stale after 10.6 s without host messages, then cleared after a ping |
| Bounded overflow | Exactly 32 cached/reachable IDs, focus on newest ID 11032, separate overflow one |
| Zero cache | Zero reachable cards, null focus, and overflow five; cleanup returned both counts to zero |

The first probe captured a real console/frame collision: a display log was
split by a framed resync reply, which the strict host classifier could not
recognize. The final firmware joins stdout's stdio lock around framed USB
writes. The retry received the resync as a complete prefixed line and passed
all the checks above. Unchanged label text and colors are also retained,
avoiding allocations and forced redraws on every 100 ms UI tick.

### Completed physical checks

| Check | User observation |
|---|---|
| Idle layout | Quarter-width CPU/MEM/NET rail and large clock/date look right; no absent battery row or stale overlay |
| Active card typography | Larger title/body are readable; both apostrophes, 東京, が, arrow, and check mark render |
| Body tap | Card stays; the compact clock remains in the rail |
| Explicit dismiss | Tapping × hides the card immediately and restores the large idle clock |
| Local dismiss readback | Host/device cache still held ID 100000 while deck reachable count became zero; the action did not close the host card |
| Three-card navigation | The user confirmed C → B → A → C through the side peek, with correct layout and no accidental dismiss |
| 33-card burst | 33 cards injected in 0.203 s; user saw `BURST 33`, `1 / 32`, and separate `+1 uncached`. One peek advanced to `BURST 32` and `2 / 32`; display stayed responsive |

During the isolated windows, ten-second alive samples showed 94–97% core 0
idle and 99–100% core 1 idle. Observed minimum heap after the burst was
73,735 bytes internal and 7,923,996 bytes PSRAM. These are short observations,
not sustained load or soak results.

At 21:03:22 PDT, the normal service restarted after restoring the original
configuration (SHA-256
`61dacdef4cdfca91efe08658285379905b16c9237960879f413152c77e678cdf`).
The service was active and linked to `f758f77b0`, mirroring was enabled again,
and readback showed zero test/cached/overflow cards with the dashboard enabled
and stale false.

### Review and source commits

The implementation was reviewed and committed locally after the hardware
checks: transport fixes in `f9c4c96`, generated fonts in `97c4a70`, and the
UI/telemetry feature in `149f52e`. Review found and fixed a touch race: a
pending arrival could change focus immediately before a peek tap, causing
navigation to skip the previewed card. Manual navigation now cancels the
pending arrival before its timer can change focus.

The reviewed source passes all 118 host tests, the native focus-policy and
dashboard-parser checks, the font coverage audit, and the firmware build
(`0x215570` app bytes; 74% free). The font generator also trims trailing blank
lines without changing glyph data. These final review changes have not been
flashed; Starship's accepted board image remains the one identified above.
This review/commit step did not push or update Snap.

This checkpoint has no soak or host-suspend gate. It does not claim a Snap
deployment or long-duration stability.
